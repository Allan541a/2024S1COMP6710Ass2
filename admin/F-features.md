In addition to the features that are auto-graded, the graphical user interface
of our project implements the following features:


 - An almost fully functional game, with only a few instances of undetectable game failure (when the fire tile blocks the cat left with only a one-grid-width passage).
 - Ability to check whether a game has succeeded or lost.
 - Ability to check legality with card placement, fire tile placement, and cat movement.
 - Cards and fire can be rotated or flipped.
 - A relaxing game background music.
 - A pop-up of string based instructions. 
 - A cool image of the Race to Raft Logo.
 - Cat purring sound effect when moving a cat.
 - Push-button selection of difficulty and card draw.
 - The only drawback is the need to enter string-based commands for placement and movement, but a preview view of rotation and flipping is provided.
