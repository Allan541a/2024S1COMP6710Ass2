### Comments 

This code review is specifically for Task 2, 3, 5, 6, 7
1. This code is structurally clear and purposeful. It is easily readable and 
2. There are plenty of useful comments throughout, providing a high level of understanding for the reader
3. The code is concise with very little wasted and repeated code 
4. Each variable name is purposeful and descriptive, using camel nomenclature. 
5. Style throughout is consistent, utilising a lot of the "!=" operators, to potentially make this more blatant and less concise, switch cases could be used.
   This would allow for elements in Task 2 to be changed easily and potential errors in the code to be more clear. But this is purely personal preference.

There isn't anything fundamental I could change, with the majority of potential critiques being personal preference
